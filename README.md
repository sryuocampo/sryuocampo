### About Me...

I am a recent graduate from LearningFuze Coding Bootcamp and just started becoming interested in coding this past year. While being in quarantine I tried a few hobbies, eventually trying some free web courses on Khan Academy. When I originally thought of code it was something that made no sense and looked like a bunch of giberish on the screen. After doing a few exercies I saw just how wrong I was. It is this language that allowed me to be creative in a way I never even thought of before. These past few months learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React have been the most challening and rewarding educational experiences so far. I love being able to create things and was able to do that in my projects, Las Kitchenas and Bark at the Park. Coming this far and being able to create these web applications get me so excited to think about how far I will be in the next few months, and years, as I continue to grow in this field.
